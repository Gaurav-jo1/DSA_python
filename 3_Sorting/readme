1. Bubble Sort - putting the biggest number at the end. (n^2)

2. Selection Sort - getting the smallest element and putting to first (n^2)

3. Insertion Sort - taking the number and putting into it's right place (n^2)

4. Merge sort - O(n log n)

5. Cycle Sort - O(n^2)

6. Quick Sort - Choosing a pivot and comparing the element in the array and merging the sorted array.

    i) Best Case: O(n log.n)
    ii) Avg Case: O(n log.n)
    iii) Worst case: Worst Case: 𝑂(𝑛^2)
